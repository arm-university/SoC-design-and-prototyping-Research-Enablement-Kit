## SoC design &amp; prototyping Research Enablement Kit

### Get started on Arm
The Research Enablement Kits are designed to help researchers get the most out of widely available Arm technologies, including DesignStart IP and [the gem5 open source simulator](https://github.com/arm-university/arm-gem5-rsk). They include software packages, models, hardware prototypes, and services to help universities worldwide harness Arm and partner-based technologies and solutions as efficiently as possible. Research Enablement Kits provide:
- Quick and simple access to Arm and partner-based IP and technologies
- High quality research materials and packages
- Detailed documentation and whitepapers

### Overview of the kit
This kit will help you design and prototype a SoC based on the Arm Cortex-M0 CPU

Arm DesignStart is the fastest route to designing and prototyping custom SoCs. This Research Enablement Kit demonstrates the SoC design flow and shows how to create an Arm-powered SoC using your custom IPs to validate your research effort.

More specifically, it shows how to integrate typical Floating-Point Unit (FPU) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) IP cores into a Cortex-M0-based SoC provided by Arm DesignStart.

You will need to download all three elements for this Research Enablement Kit:
